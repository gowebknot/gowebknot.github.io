## Dart Introduction
An open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google. designed for building fast and expressive applications across various platforms.

### Key Features
- Object-Oriented
- Statically Typed (Variable types are known at compile-time)
- Multi-platform Support:¬†Build web,¬†mobile (Flutter),¬†desktop applications with one language.
- Package Manager: [pub.dev](http://pub.dev)
- Null Safety

### Dart Installation

Refer to the link below to setup Dart SDK. -  [Get the Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### DartPad
Online tool to write and run Dart code. - [DartPad](http://dartpad.dev)

### ‚ú™ Language Fundamentals

*  Variables [*Official Docs*](https://dart.dev/language/variables)
    - `var`  and  `dynamic` ‚Üí [*link*](https://github.com/MovingMelody/learn-dart/blob/main/lib/Variables/var_vs_dynamic.dart)
    - `late` variables
    - `final` and `const` ‚Üí [*link*](https://github.com/MovingMelody/learn-dart/blob/main/lib/Variables/final_const_var.dart)

    - File I/O
    - Maps
    - Sorting
    - String Manipulations
    - Regex

*Timelines* - Complete this project within 2 days from when you start this assignment

## Object Oriented Programming

* ‚ú™ OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Concepts
    - Classes & Objects
    - Class Modifiers (`abstract` , `sealed` , `base` , `final` , `interface` ) [*link*](https://dart.dev/language/modifier-reference)
    - Enums
    - Constructors (`Named`, `Default`, `Redirecting`, `Factory`)
        - Initializer List
        - usage of `super` , `this` inside constructors
    - Abstract Classes
        - Toggle
            1. Abstract methods (unimplemented - only method signature no body) vs concrete methods (implemented) 
            2. Why abstract can‚Äôt be instantiated
            3. Concrete subclass behaviour when abstract class is extended
            4. Can one `abstract` extend another `abstract` class ?
    - Inheritance (`extends`, `implements`) & Mixins
    - Polymorphism
* ‚ú™ Error/Exception Handling
    - Try, catch, finally blocks.
    - Throwing and handling exceptions

## Advanced Dart Concepts
* ‚ú™ Concurrency
    - Future and async/await ‚Üí Asynchronous Programming
    - Streams
    - Isolates
* ‚ú™ Unit Testing in Dart
* Generics

- Focus Areas:
    - Asynchronous Programming
    - OOP
    - Dealing with API calls (HTTP)
    - Exception Handling
    - User Input Handling

*Timelines* - Complete this project within 3 days from when you start this assignment
