* Follow instructions to install Java and Maven - [https://techdevlife.wordpress.com/2020/04/20/sdkman-install-java-maven/](https://techdevlife.wordpress.com/2020/04/20/sdkman-install-java-maven/)
* Install Java version 11 or greater
* Install Intellij Idea community edition - [https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/intellij-idea-win.html](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/intellij-idea-win.html)
* Install git on your local machine
* Clone this basic [git repository](https://github.com/jabedhasan21/java-hello-world-with-maven/tree/master) and run a hello world program
* If you can run it, you are set.


## Assignment 1
* Once you have learnt it, implement the following with Java 
    * Implement a Java application with a main function that can do the following tasks
        * Create a new Product - with product details
            * Name

            * Product should have a function to return billing price by adding tax to the Selling price

        * Create a store - with details and products 
            * Store name
            * Store address
            * Store contact number
            * List of products in a store 
            * Store should have a function that accepts product code and returns the product object
        * In the main function 
            * Create two store objects
            * Create 10 products for each store 
            * Create function to get price of product by code in a store
            * Create function to get stock value of a product by code in a store

#### Bonus Task 
* Add a function in the main class to create a cart list with products and get final cost of the products in the cart.

## Assignment 2
* Once you have complete assignment 1, you should be able to create store, create products, add products to store and perform other tasks
* As a follow up to assignment 1, please work on the following
    * Use a json file to import products into your store. All product information should be in a json and this needs to be imported.
    * Use Serializers/Deserializers to do the same. Hint: Use jackson object mapper dependencies to achieve the same
